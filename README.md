# Supply Chain Simulation & Forecasting Platform

> **Your digital twin for resilient, data-driven supply chain decision-making**

This platform is a modular, AI-powered application MVP, designed to simulate, forecast, and optimize supply chain operations ‚Äî all in real time. It empowers supply chain professionals, analysts, and researchers to model complex networks, predict demand, run disruption scenarios, visualize downstream risks, and perform cost-emissions-risk tradeoffs, all through an intuitive and interactive Streamlit interface.

Whether you're managing global logistics or prototyping smart factories, this tool turns your supply chain into a living, learning system.
